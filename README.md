# Chromatix-node

#How to use it
===
1. git clone this repository(with node_module)
2. yarn start (for start the node server)
3. http://localhost:8080/   (with chrome or postman)

#Note
===
when I test this code test, for some reason there may be a error about Cannot find module 'async-each' when you are using yarn
start command. so use "yarn add async" or "npm install async --save" to solve the issue then you should be able to use yarn 
start again for testing.
